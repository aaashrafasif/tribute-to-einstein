              <p>Albert Einstein is often cited as one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century. His work
                continues to help
                astronomers study everything from gravitational waves to Mercury's orbit.
                <br><br>
                The scientist's equation that helped explain special relativity – E = mc^2 – is famous even among those
                who don't
                understand its underlying physics. Einstein is also known for his theory of general relativity (an
                explanation of
                gravity), and the photoelectric effect (which explains the behavior of electrons under certain
                circumstances); his work
                on the latter earned him a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.</p>
